# ⭐ Gradious Apprenticeship Code Repository

This is my official **Gradious Apprenticeship** code repository, containing all programs I write during my training on the **Gradious platform**.

This repository is ongoing and will continue to grow as I progress further in the course.

## 📘 About This Repository

This repository acts as my **learning journal**, helping me:

* Track my progress week by week
* Organize all codes in one place
* Improve through consistent practice
* Showcase my work publicly

All programs written during Gradious training sessions are uploaded here regularly.
